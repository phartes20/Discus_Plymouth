site loads but doesn't function

Haven't managed to connect / transfrer files using filezilla
tried to transfer files via cpanel manager -- not sure how successful. some images not transferred. Too big / too many?
Filezilla works fine from home -- doesn't work from office. Tried with VPN, also doesn't work. Harry Hocking opens support case. 

works fine from home. Something blocked here? window loads but doesn't execute. 


Next:	try to get space from IT Plymouth
	Try again FileZilla / transfer files, etc. Can i get it to work?
	Ask Martyn for help. (swing by w/c 12 May, all days exc Wednesday)
